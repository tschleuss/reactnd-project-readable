# [React Nanodegree Project #2] Readable

This is the _Readable_ project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.

This repository [reactnd-project-readable-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll need to use to interact with the front-end portion of the project.

##To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm i`
* start the development server with `npm start`
